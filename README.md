# Fake News Classification

## Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles as either real or fake. In an era where misinformation spreads rapidly through social media and other online platforms, fake news has become a significant concern. Such misleading claims can polarize public opinion and spread misinformation. To combat this issue, this project employs various machine learning techniques to identify and classify fake news.

To achieve this, several models were developed and evaluated, including:
- **TfidfVectorizer** and **PassiveAggressive Classifier** from **sklearn**
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**
- **Google BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**

The effectiveness of these models was compared to determine the most accurate approach for detecting fake news. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of more reliable news sources by identifying the best-performing model for this task.
